This script consists of two functions: populate_dictionary(filename) and find_email(argv). The function populate_dictionary(filename) reads the user_emails.csv file and populates a dictionary with name/value pairs. The other function, find_emails(argv), searches the dictionary created in the previous function for the user name passed to the function as a parameter. It then returns the associated email address. This script accepts employee's first name and last name as command-line arguments and outputs their email address.
