In this lab, i changed the list.txt username  from "jane" to "jdoe" . I wrote a bash script and a Python script that will take care of the necessary rename operations.


**-findJane.sh**

This script should catch all "jane" lines and store them in another text file called oldFiles.txt.

**-changeJane.py**

This Python script takes oldFiles.txt as a command line argument and  renames files with the new username "jdoe".
